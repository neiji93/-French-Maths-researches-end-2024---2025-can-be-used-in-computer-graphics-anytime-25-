May be completely stupid but I have to do it myself

"Formes automorphes continues sur un espace vectorielle à 11 dimensions (matrix model) et
eries génératrices associées

Théroei des nombres et congruences sur un espace de hilbert : conservation des 
propritétés automorphes (helped by my nephew Edis Louis Rasulov - may be just a high school program)

Intervalles continues dans un sur espace v myope et équations topologiques a 11 dimensions ! will ask my nephew arda dilaver tosyali to help me). this one is interesting. plus, it will help for crypto currency 
whaoouuuuh cool ! using blockchain technology to get GRF ! then this is possible nowadays !

formes automorohes finie et corps... ?? de dimension finie (nous navons pas besoin dinfinie grace a ma reconnaissance zn tant suartiste !)

In order ro help my nephews and my niece come back to mathematical topics deeper than before, I must help them being artists.
This will surely help ! Great !


Données médicales (à partir en partie de mes recherches sur des outils de chirurgie de tout le corps ) :
injection, injection double et variables latentes de modèles de simulation.  (on dirait de l IA).


----------------------- PHYSICS ----------------------------
 1/ something with exp(11) because log(x) was too much used and because exp(11^2) = cos x + i sin(x).
 This formulas is interesting but I have to follow my intuition and share with you why I chosed it !
 --> will be used for champo alternative implement OS.


 2/ (4 dimension - (4*1*2*1*x)*2 -> this was a physical event dreamed where I was trapped)
 16x non simulation model that preserve muted
 planck's constant. Usefull for rendering encoded signals (let's see other repositories and texttEditor1.h). x can be c = 3*10^8.
 But we have to modify c. Then, let's talk about c = 250 (like 250 volts). As stars can be described as models,
 we can have mixed models if we use y=16 as a constant later. It seems heat trabsfer ! This is perfectly ok for LCD screen rendering.
 Let's propagate the signals between several different ceramics chips ! Don't forget to prevent crashing chips by checking exponent62 !



3/ Diffeomorphism to homeomorphism that approximate 3 forces acting in a closed space (acting on each others).


----------------Physics for video games------------------------------

I used exp(0.6) in a project because I didn't use the 6 number in maths too much times. It is smart.. On the hand, I previously
used exp(3x)) in another project (I don't remeber where I used it sincerely). Then, I asked myself if There were ways to use
them in Runge Khutta 4 approximate method. It ended with google books. Here is one link but other links were corrupted in my pc but
I remember coupling and recusive keyowrds. So here is one link :

 ----CGI-----

 1/ i want to use formal power series for a and one of the elements abive to continue cgi softwares. there mist be a way. even physics or maths. why can we use maths ? because can use exp(3x) three times which means that this .... i will complete it later. there must be a way.

 using dirac delta for higher orders to prevent money cash to be infinite for crypto currency project. as im an artist, it leans using formal series again.

extension de corps, peut etre en utilisant l algebre de clifford, pour les comportements ottoseconds !
peut etre utilise dans les jeux videos notament avec mon projet fuzzy a'd fair datas. on pourra peut etre utiliser les rrvaux de anne l huilier qui a recu un prox nobel !
